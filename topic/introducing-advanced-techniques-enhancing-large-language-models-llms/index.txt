This talk introduces key strategies for maximizing LLM performance, integrating graph databases, and advancing RAG methodologies. We’ll delve into topics such as optimization flows and prompt engineering while also examining the synergy between LLMs and graph technology through knowledge graphs and vector searches. Additionally, we’ll showcase advanced approaches in RAG, including multi-modal and ensemble retrievers, highlighting practical applications and potential pitfalls. This session is designed for AI practitioners seeking to harness the full potential of LLMs in their projects.</p>"}]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"container my-4","children":[["$","div","Dr. Chung Ng",{"className":"box my-2","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"media","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"media-left","children":["$","figure",null,{"className":"image is-128x128","children":["$","img",null,{"src":"https://data.hkoscon.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/Chung%20Ng%20250_0.jpg","alt":"Dr. Chung Ng"}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"media-content","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"content","children":[["$","p",null,{"children":["$","strong",null,{"children":"Dr. Chung Ng / Hong Kong"}]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"HKT Limited"}],["$","hr",null,{}],["$","$L2",null,{"description":"<p>Dr. Chung is a SVP at Group CTO Office of the HKT/PCCW Group, where he’s responsible for leading the group’s product and technology roadmap<br>and strategic development.
